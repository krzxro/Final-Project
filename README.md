Foundations of Data Science - Final Project

The dataset analyzed in this project consists of gene expression counts from various patient
samples. The focus gene, GCLC, plays a crucial role in the catalytic (active) part of the
glutamate-cysteine ligase enzyme (a rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis), which is
the process cells use to make glutathione, an important antioxidant that protects cells from
damage - such as free radicals or toxins. This analysis explores the distribution of GCLC
expression, its correlation with another gene (gene NFYA), and variation across different
pathologic stages of cancer.
